# Smart System
A smart system designed for high-reliability on low costing hardware. Aims to aid in the future development of smart homes and Systems.

# Motivation
Smart home system inspired by the [HDFS] (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html#Streaming+Data+Access)(Hadoop Distributed File System) architecture, particularly the Hadoop Cluster design approach for the storing and analyzing of large volume of unstructured data. A general smart structure that permits, connections between sensors. External sensors interact with a controller system, whilst corresponding with a storage system.

# Design
+ Virtual network associated with Controllers
+ Virtual NAS (or similar distributed storage)
+ Flow of data: Sensor --> Controller Private Network <--> Storage Private Network
+ Redundancy with fail-over (either load-balancing or active-standby for reliability) in controllers and physical storage.

Testing something...
